# Disease Symptom Checker using Rule-Based Diagnosis

## Problem Statement
Develop a **C++ console application** that accepts symptoms as input from the user and matches them to a predefined **rule base** to output probable diseases. The rules should be based on common symptom combinations.

## Objectives
- Practice **rule-based decision systems**  
- Simulate **diagnosis** from user-input symptoms

## Key Features
- Accept multiple symptoms as input  
- Match symptoms against a rule set (e.g., *fever + cough → Flu*)  
- Display one or more possible diagnoses  
- Maintain a rule base using **arrays** or **maps**

## Input
- Symptoms entered by the user (e.g., *“fever”*, *“cough”*, *“headache”*)

## Output
- List of likely diseases (e.g., *“Flu”*, *“Dengue”*)

## Tools / Libraries
- **C++ STL**: `map`, `vector`, `set`  
- **Optional**: File input for storing and reading rules

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Matching accuracy**  
- **Rule coverage and flexibility**  
- **Ease of modifying rules**
